               <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language[1] for creating a webpage. In easier words, HTML is a kind of programming language that can make a new webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can display them correctly. HTML also adds meta information to a webpage. Meta information is usually not shown by web browsers and is data about the web page, e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style HTML elements while JavaScript is used for website behavior and also changing the HTML and CSS.</p>
